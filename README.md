# ssb handbook ![](assets/hermes.png)

A work-in-progress guide to the ssb-verse and key concepts and influences

You can build and serve this with gitbook. The following assumes you're running a scuttlebot server and are in the follow neighbourhood of mixmix or his pub.

```bash
npm install gitbook-cli git-ssb -g
git clone ssb://address ssb-handbook 
cd ssb-handbook
gitbook install
gitbook serve
```

The `SUMMARY.md` is the manifest on which the compiled gitbook is based. Edit that if you want content in/out of the book.
