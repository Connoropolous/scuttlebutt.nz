## Subjective

Scuttlebutt embraces subjectivity. You are your own central authority on truth.

There is no "objective" truth, no global singleton, no consensus process.

Each peer can publish whatever they want, and interpret another message however they want. The meaning is created when two peers have the same interpretation. You don't get to choose how someone interprets you, but you may choose how you interpret them.

## Hostless

Scuttlebutt is hostless: each computer installs the same copy of software and has equal rights in the network.

While there are [public peer servers](./pub.html), they are identical to the client peers rather than a special role. We feel that this doesn't make it not a peer to peer protocol, since anyone can run them, and your identity is not tied to them as in `email@domain`.

## Local-Area Networks

Devices discover each other over the LAN with multicast UDP and sync automatically.
