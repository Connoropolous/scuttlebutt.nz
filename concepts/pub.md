# Pub

To sync across the Internet, "Pub" nodes run at public IPs and follow users. They are essentially mail-bots which improve uptime and availability. Users generate invite-codes to command Pubs to follow their friends. The Scuttlebot community runs some Pubs, and anybody can create and introduce their own.
