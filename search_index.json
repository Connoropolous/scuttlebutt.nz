way to get started is using Patchwork, an application for navigating and talking on scuttlebutt.\n1. Download Patchwork for Windows, macOS and Linux\n2. Get a pub invite codeUse the pub invite : in Patchwork click + Join Pub and paste the invite code\n\nStep 2 is important if you want to be able to find people further than your local network - it sets you up with a robot friend on the internet which helps you find and communicate with people.\nRead more about Pubs and their role here.Join The CommunityOnce onboard patchwork, check out the following channels by typing their name (with #) in the search bar:#new-people: introduce yourself\n\n#faq: first impressions, what is confusing as a new user?\n\n#patchwork: report bugs, suggestions, etc\n\n#scuttlebutt: protocol related discussion\n\nHere are some other favourites:#boats: people living on, hacking, and building boats\n\n#cooking-channel: nerds sharing recipes\n\n#solarpunk: step into the future\n\n#gardening: get some gardening on with your off-grid\n\n#anarchitecture: decentralise all the things\n\nCode of conductPlease note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.Have Other Questions?A great place to learn more is our FAQ pageIn addition, you'll find a wealth of resources within this handbook, accessible through the sidebar.The resources are organized by these topics:Contributing\n\nTalks\n\nApplications\n\nPrinciples\n\nFAQ\n\nStories\n\nModules\n\nConcepts\n\nGuides\n\nGlossary\n\n"},"applications.html":{"url":"applications.html","title":"Applications","keywords":"","body":"Scuttlebutt AppsYour scuttlebutt is the data you carry with you - imagine a little slice of a parallel universe in your pocket.\nThis data is yours and you can interact with it however you like.These apps are different kinds of magic glasses to help you interact with this reality.\nTry different glasses on, change them when you're bored, make some new ones that fit you better ... your scuttleverse doesn't mind - it's just data.Come explore with us!\nIf you are new, you might like to start with Patchwork! \n  \n    Social views\n    Coordination views\n    Data viz / tools\n  \n  \n     \n      Direct posting / conversation:\n      \n        Patchwork\n        Patchbay\n        Patchfoo\n        Minbase\n        MMMMM\n        Patchwork Classic\n      \n\n      Other:\n      \n        ssb-chess\n        patch-book\n        Ticktack (blogging)\n        Ferment (music)\n      \n    \n     \n      \n        patch-gatherings\n        git-ssb\n      \n    \n     \n      \n        ssb-usage-stats\n        ssb-graphviz\n        easy-ssb-pub\n      \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nPatchworkA decentralized messaging and sharing app built using patchcore.

specifically, it avoids using a Distributed Hash Table or a global blockchain.SSB avoids P2P singletons partially to show that it can be done (most P2P designs use DHT or global blockchains) and also because those are just P2P versions of centralized systems.\nSocial Networks are already constructed around a decentralized experience.\nPopular social networks (fb, twitter) have centralized implementations, but you use them to interact with your peers, so on that level they are P2P.SecureScuttlebutt takes this decentralized experience and maps the networking layer (the key part of the implementation) on top of the decentralized human/user network.\nIt would be a shame to go to all that trouble to decentralize, but then adopt a singleton.\nAlso, global blockchains are heavy (require nodes to store entire chain, and to waste CPU power) and DHTs are susceptible to spam.\nThese structures also both make the network unprivate, by making all information available globally.That said, like any good tool, SSB has been built to interoperate with other programs.\nThough it's important to us that core remain viable without singletons, the community is free to add protocols wherever they see fit, and is encouraged to do so."},"stories/design-challenge-sybil-attacks.html":{"url":"stories/design-challenge-sybil-attacks.html","title":"Design Challenge: Sybil Attacks","keywords":"","body":"Design Challenge: Sybil AttacksIf it is possible for an anyone to connect to a computer system then it may be possible to interfere with the operation of that system, and defenses against interference must be designed in.For example, email's design is vulnerable to spam.\nTo send someone an email, all that is required is to have their email address; email is unsolicited messaging, so it's easy to send nuisance or fraud emails.Spam FiltersEmail systems deal with spam by filtering it out.\nThere are two basic approaches:\nThe simplest is pattern matching - messages are compared to models of the sort of messages that spammers send.\nThis produces an arms race between spammers and spam filterers.\nSpammers must strive to create messages which beat the filter, while filterers have to improve their model.One particularly interesting example of this is (snail) mail advertisers that employ handwriting services to write the addresses on their envelopes.\nThis fools the receiver into believing that an actual human sent them the letter making them much more likely to open it. \n(This is even being automated.)Social NetworksThe other approach is to use social/trust networks.\nServices like Facebook or Twitter are significantly less vulnerable to spam (if you dont consider the ads spam).\nInstead of receiving personal messages from anyone one who knows your id/address on a social network, you only receive messages from other users you have \"followed\" or \"friended\".We like to call this a \"Solicited Spam\" system.\nFollowing someone on Twitter means you think they are human, or at least, an amusing bot.\nThis is actually a pretty strong signal.\nEmail doesn't have an explicit social network, but the best spam filtered email systems (like gmail) can use the implicit social network in email: if I send you and email and you reply then we are \"friends\".Then graph analysis can be applied to the friend network - spammers may be isolated, or clustered together and can be filtered out.By building SecureScuttlebutt around a social network, preventing spam becomes easy.\nSince, in a social network application, you only communicate with trusted peers (friends) anyway, and there is usually an explicit \"follow\" mechanism which expresses who you trust, and humans are pretty good at detecting frauds.\nThis is why SSB was made as an inherently social system."},"stories/gossiping-securely-is-the-new-email.html":{"url":"stories/gossiping-securely-is-the-new-email.html","title":"Gossiping Securely is the new Email","keywords":"","body":"Gossiping Securely is the new EmailIf you’re still using email for direct communication, you’re probably facing some well known problems : spam, provider lockin, privacy, and reliability (doesn’t work without the internet).I’ve helped build an app called Patchwork which sidesteps these problems. Patchwork is built on an open gossip network. Here’s how it works:In the network everyone has a diary which only they can write to.\n\nWhen you bump into a friend, you can make a photocopy of their diary.\n\nTo send a message to a friend, I leave a message in my diary and scramble (encrypt) the words using a code only that friend can read.\n\nWhen I read my friends diaries, any scrambled message I can decode must have been for me, any I can’t must have been meant for someone else.\n\nThat sounds a bit complicated!It does, but the good news is you don’t need to know any crypotogrpahy, you can just install Patchwork, and it works like email.\nIt looks like this at the moment:\nDirect messaging in PatchworkOh, other good news is that your intuition how information is passed by gossip pretty much translates to Patchwork:you gossip with friends (and sometimes friends of friends)\n\nyou don’t gossip with people your friends don’t trust\n\nyou gossip about mutual friends\n\nThe major exception is that unlike people-gossip, this gossip is cryptographically 99.9999999% impossible to fake.It’s like all the good things about gossip, with all the bad things like misinformation taken out.This setup eliminates spam and abusive actors, because over time no-one will talk with them, and hence their messages are not passed on.\nBecause the system is built on gossip, you don’t need to be on the internet to do it. Whenever you’re on the same wifi as a friend your computers will gossip. Patchwork will also swing by known ‘pubs’ (like public houses on the internet) and catch up on gossip there.\nThe network doesn’t need a central provider, so you can’t be locked into some corporation.\nThe direct messages are all hardcore encrypted by default and unlike encrypted email, no-one can even tell who you were messaging.A view of the network — I’m the purple node, the others are Peers (green = gossiping). Large nodes are pubs on the net.What are the downsides?Patchwork is currently only built for desktops and laptops (no phones). .\nThe setup is also such that you have one identity per device — this means you have to have different identities for each computer you have. This problem is less of a challenge, and is also on our roadmap.Patchwork is currently in closed beta. We use Patchwork to build Patchwork, and have a small but active social network (you can also gossip publicly). \nIf you’d like to help us build this future, we’d love help from storytellers, designers, entrepreneurs, and coders.\nWe think we could be of great services to journalists, activists, and people without internet.\nPlease feel free to get in touch if you’d like to join us — mix@enspiral.com"},"stories/scuttlebutt-genesis.html":{"url":"stories/scuttlebutt-genesis.html","title":"Scuttlebutt Genesis","keywords":"","body":"Scuttlebutt Genesis@bobhaugen hey, I first became interested in p2p a few years back. I was a bit burnt out from the previous job and was living in a sailboat in a swamp in Auckland, NZ. Playing around with frontend code (because I usually did backend) I realized that there was a disconnect between the way that frontend works (change events moving between layers) and backend (request/response to the database) why couldn't it all be change events?Then I realized that git essentially modeled change events, and that a system based on replication would work really well offline because you'd have a valid copy of the data always at hand (pretty useful in a sailboat). So i started looking into git and implemented a replication prototype https://github.com/dominictarr/snob I spoke about this at my local javascript meetup and got a very enthusiastic response! I hadn't had a good response for one of my \"crazy\" ideas before, so I decided I should just work on that and see where it took me.Important influences here where the amazon dynamo paper, CRDTs, git and couchdb. Couchdb's most interesting feature is the changes feed which allows you to \"tail\" the database and synchronize changes. I don't think couchdb's replication is very good, but it still raised the bar.After a while my experiments distilled into https://github.com/dominictarr/scuttlebutt which should now be called \"insecure scuttlebutt\". That work got me invited to speak at conferences, particularily one in Ireland, nodedublin (now nodeconf.eu). nearform (organizers of nodedublin) where also interested in in database replication, I started working with them to develop a new replicatable database product.\nIn the end, nearform pivoted away from that idea, but everything I had done was opensource and that introduced me into leveldb, and learned me a lot about databases.Camlistore was an important influence - it is immutable, with hashes for keys, but you can query the database with search instead of the keys, which overcomes awkwardness of not being able to choose the keys.I didn't like camlistore's replication protocol. It was too batch-mode, and not particularily efficient. I did some experiments looking for a general purpose replication protocol but decided it wasn't possible. I saw cryptosphere which is a distributed filesystem project, but uses replicated logs to record which peers are cooperative, basically a trust network. https://github.com/cryptosphere/cryptosphere/wiki/Philosophy\nReplicating logs is easy, so that is good, but instead of building a boring filesystem on top of a trust network... why not just expose that directly to the humans? I realized that all the web2.0 apps are basically just replicated logs, and basically implicit trust networks, and that this was a particularily easy architecture to decentralize.What makes it easy is that since you more or less explicitly \"follow\" or \"friend\" people that defers the spam prevention to the humans in a way that seems natural. Contrast with email, where spam prevention is a messy soft-AI problem.This also dovetailed with earlier ideas about trust networks, that I didn't know how to persue at the time. For example, experts have reputations, and can teach or certify students, but are disincentiveized from misvouching because they will loose their reputation if thier students are found incompetent. This was while I was at university and felt that a degree stamped by the university didn't mean very much, and was also very restrictive in terms of subject matter etc. Building a decentralized trust network seemed like a very good idea. One of the key insights of web 2.0 is that users respond to UI, making them aware of an option means they can do it. Users and UI flow together. A certain UI design may influence user behavior, and this also works at higher layers, certain application technology influences possible applications and certain economic models influences business models. I had worked witnessed some terrible software in my day, but recoginized that it was terrible for social reasons more than technical... I seek more equitable social arrangements because I think it will create better software. Everything is becoming software right? so if more equitable circumstances produces better software then the good software can kill the bad software.By this time I had figured out the basic architecture and was starting to work on it. I had noticed @paul's work, and recoginized it's importantance as another part of the puzzle. I wanted an open platform that anyone could build things on (as twitter was originally pitched, but has closed off they try to monetize etc). Also, we couldn't realistically plan to just sit down and create an app that everyone wants to use, we need many experiments so that one can succeed, therefore we need an decentralized application platform more than we need any given a decentralized application."},"stories/using-trust-in-open-networks.html":{"url":"stories/using-trust-in-open-networks.html","title":"Using Trust in Open Networks","keywords":"","body":"Using Trust in Open NetworksOpen networks are systems that allow participation without deferring to central authority.\nThe Web, Email, BitTorrent, IPFS, and SecureScuttlebutt are all open networks.Open networks try to maximise their potential value by letting agents contribute and extract data independently, and without intermediation.\nThis is the Laissez-faire approach to architecture, and it frequently benefits from the efficiency of horizontal scaling.In SecureScuttlebutt, we have decided never to adopt centralized authorities in the protocol.\nThis decision was motivated by\n 1. distrust of information monocultures\n 2. desire to maximize autonomy of individual users\n 3. general curiosityThis constraint pushes us to find novel solutions for shared datastructures.\nThis article will summarize literature on trust-based mechanisms, and offer some perspective to how they can be applied to SecureScuttlebutt.Trust-ranking is a key feature of open networks with shared data-structures.\nAs each agent receives new information, it must decide how to act on it, and decide whether to discard the input.\nSpam, resource-leaching, and DoS attacks would otherwise overwhelm the agents.Email is an open network: anybody can create a server and account.\nAnd, the inbox a shared structure: users share append-rights over each others' inboxes.\nBut, without proper spam-filtering, email is nearly useless.\nFiltering must be both effective (very little spam) and accurate (very few false positives) or email loses its utility.A survey of trust in computer science and the Semantic Web names two primary means of managing trust.Policy-based trust. Using policies to establish trust, focused on managing and exchanging credentials and enforcing access policies. Work in policy-based trust generally assumes that trust is established simply by obtaining a sufficient amount of credentials.Reputation-based trust. Using reputation to establish trust, where past interactions or performance for an entity are combined to assess its future behavior. Research in reputation-based trust uses the history of an entity's actions/behavior to compute trust, and may use referral-based trust (information from others) in the absence of (or in addition to) first-hand knowledge.SecureScuttlebutt uses social \"following\" relations as a base trust-policy.\nUsers choose which feeds to follow, and therefore opt into every messaging partner.\nThis is how SSB controls spam.Other trust-policies could be leveraged by SSB applications, to give users authority over other shared data-structures.\nFor instance, users could assign friends the right to follow more users on their behalf, or give moderator powers to enable post-hiding.However, policies scale poorly, as they require the user to make a decision about every other agent in the network.\nThis makes it hard for a user to evaluate information produced by \"strangers\", even if the stranger is only one or two social hops away.\nTo solve this, reputation-based trust can be introduced to build upon the user's decisions, by analyzing the decisions of other agents, and assigning authority automatically.To understand reputation-based trust, let's look at a common application of them, search engines.\nPageRank is still one of the top search algorithms in use, so it's important to understand where it fits in the current landscape of research.Propagation Models for Trust and Distrust in Social Networks does a good job explaining PageRank's qualities, in section 2.\nFrom there, and from other papers:PageRank is a probabilistic analysis, of a random surfer clicking links through the Web. The common alternative is path-analysis, which is the sort of thing that PGP does in its WoT.\n\nTrust Management for the Semantic Web and The EigenTrust Algorithm for Reputation Management in P2P Networks are two good papers on probabilistic analysis. Both of these try to generalize PageRank. Eigentrust is cited a lot by other papers.\n\nPropagation Models for Trust and Distrust in Social Networks is a good resource for path-analysis, as it explains Advogadro and a novel algorithm called Appleseed.\n\nPageRank operates with global information, and seeks to be objective (everyone's opinion) instead of subjective (google's opinion). Google crawls the Web to get global knowledge of the graph.\n\nPageRank infers that links are recommendations from one page to another. That's usually a correct assumption, but not always. Semantic Web research tries to use richer signals (explicit recommendations of pages, ratings of trust between agents, ratings of belief in facts, etc) and then construct better analysis. \n\nPageRank relies on weblinks being transitive recommendations. The algorithm does not apply for recommendations that aren't transitive. For instance, inter-agent trust signals are not always transitive, and distrust signals are never transitive.\n\nBecause PageRank creates global ratings for pages, it's actually estimating the global reputation of a page. Reputation is different from trust, because trust is subjective (from a particular node's perspective) and reputation is objective (from the whole network's perspective).\n\nMany algorithms, including Eigentrust and Advogato, rely on a seed set of trusted peers. The seed-set makes it possible to detect malicious rings that work together to elevate their rating. The original PageRank paper doesn't have any such seed-set, but in practice I imagine Google has an equivalent. (I question whether the analysis can be called \"objective\" if there is such a seed-set.)\n\nThese lessons can easily apply when writing graph-analysis algorithms for SecureScuttlebutt.\nInferring the wrong properties about the input data, such as edge-transitivity, can lead the algorithm to draw wrong conclusions.\nAs the purpose of reputation is to automate trust decisions, it's important not to make those mistakes.The data model is also very important to reputation-based trust, and is frequently explored in the literature I found.\nThere is no consensus on which model is best; they vary by application and intent.The EigenTrust Algorithm for Reputation Management in P2P Networks applies probabilistic analysis on a dataset of rated transactions.\nAfter every file-download, users publish whether the downloaded file was as-advertised.\nThe ratings are accumulated and normalized to quantify the trustworthiness of peers.\nThe authors assume that trusted peers are likely to make good trust decisions as well, and so they use the trust-values transitively to fill holes in the dataset.\nAt a glance, the XRep algorithm seems to work in roughly the same way.Eigentrust is not a social system; it's a p2p mesh of file-hosts, which abstracts the hosts away from the user's awareness.\nTheir data model, therefore, doesn't use direct trust-ratings between agents, whereas SSB can.\nIn contrast, the TrustMail algorithm sets ratings directly on agents.Trust Management for the Semantic Web splits the model into \"belief ratings for statements\" and \"trust ratings for agents\"[We] propose a solution to the problem of establishing the degree of belief in a statement that is explicitly asserted by one or more sources on the Semantic Web. ... Our basic model is that a user's belief in a statement should be a function of her trust in the sources providing it.They offer both path-algebra and probabilistic interpretations for the graph, and a number of options for the formulas.Modeling and Evaluating Trust Network Inference describes an even more sophisticated model.\nFirst, they isolate trust into domains, following the intuition that an agent may be an expert in one field, but not in another.\nThen, in section 2.4.2, they define 2 categories of trust, and subdivide them into 5 types.\nThe categories are referral trust (\"reflects an agent's estimation about the quality of the other agents' knowledge\") and associative trust (\"reflects the similarity between two agents\").\nThe subdivisions are as follows:Domain Expert Trust (DET) is referral trust that evaluates the quality of an agent's domain knowledge. Intuitively, DET is not transitive, but DET may imply RET (see next item) on the same domain.\n\nRecommendation Expert Trust (RET) is referral trust that evaluates an agent's trust knowledge. In real world, the domain used in RET is often much wider than DET, e.g. CNN is a domain expert only in news area, while Google.com is a recommendation expert in almost any area. Moreover, RET in transitive according to its definition, so it can be used to propagate both DET and RET.\n\nSimilar belief trust (SBT) is an associative trust that evaluates the similarity of two agents' domain knowledge. Intuitively, SBT clusters information providers, and it can be used to propagate DET.\n\nSimilar trusting trust (STT) is an associative trust that evaluates the similarity of two agents' trust knowledge. Intuitively, STT clusters trustors (agents who maintain trust knowledge), and it can be used to propagate both DET and RET. Computing STT needs trust knowledge from only two agents.\n\nSimilar cited trust (SCT) is an associative trust that evaluates the similarity of how two agents are trusted.  Intuitively, STT clusters trustees (agents who are trusted) by their reputation, and it can be used to propagate both DET and RET. Reliable SCT requires trust knowledge from a large population of agents.\n\nThis is not the first group to separate DET and RET.\nThe Hilltop and HITS algorithms make that distinction as well.The values used to rate agents or data varies between the algorithms.\nRoughly, they tend to be trinary (trusted/distrusted/no-opinion) or real (0..1, or 0..10, etc).\nI've found nothing definitive about which is best.When choosing the model, we should remember that reputation systems exist to rank information in the absense of local input.\nIf the user were able to rate all inputs a-priori, a policy system would suffice.\nSince the user can not, a reputation system merges the inputs of many users to fill holes in the data structure.If we want to entrust function-critical decisions to shared data, we need to be robust to malicious behaviors.\nThe Appleseed Paper provides useful analysis of this:The \"bottleneck property\" [is] common feature of attack-resistant trust metrics. Informally, this property states that the \"trust quantity accorded to an edge s -> t is not significantly affected by changes to the successors of t.\"Put another way, the bottleneck property holds if a voting ring is not able to elevate its reputation the network by recommending each other.\nThis property requires subjectivity: trust must flow outward from a seed set.\nFortunately, SecureScuttlebutt is subjective by nature.The other concern we must address is compromise-risk: we should minimize the danger of a trusted node acting maliciously.\nTwo techniques for handling this:Always distribute authority. A security-critical change should be backed by multiple trusted agents.\n\nWatch for anomolous events and alert the user. If a kind of change is rare, confirm it before accepting it.\n\nA few notes on how computation occurs.\nIn addition to the path-algebra vs probabilistic analysis, there's a split among the papers between making distributed vs centralized/localized computations.Distributed computation uses realtime queries to peers for trust information.\nCentralized/localized computation aggregates information at a node, and then computes across that aggregated information.Both Google and SecureScuttlebutt qualify as centralized/localized.\nThe difference is that Google tries to obtain global knowledge of the network, via crawling, while SSB obtains a localized neighborhood of the network.The community is encouraged to supplement SecureScuttlebutt's localized computation with distributed protocols, but it's not currently expected that SSB core will include any distributed computation systems itsemf, due to the scope creep that would create.It may be possible to generalize a universal system for ranking the trust and quality of data in SecureScuttlebutt.\nIf so, then a single \"ranking\" application would be able to publish and review data structures.\nHowever, I'm unsure that's possible.\nIn the near-term, I suggest we study applications and data-structures separately, and watch for unifying principles.There are a few applications which I think we should focus our attention on, because they'll yield the most insight, and value, to the network.An intelligent crawler which expands on the user's follow relationships. This application would start with the user's explicit follows, and then analyze the network to find feeds, messages, and blobs that are worth downloading. This might be viewed as attempting to automate virality. The algorithm will need to balance its options against available disk space.\n\nA search engine for messages, feeds, and blobs. This is a very broad application, and so may be hard to address early, but it will have a lot of relevance, insight, and value for the network. It also makes a strong companion to the intelligent crawler, as it lets you discover what the crawler has fetched for you. And, the queries may act as inputs to the crawler, since queries signal your interests.\n\nA whois application. Without name authorities, naming becomes a kind of search that must produce only one result.

(...)On consensus, I enjoy Locke's philosophy of social contract. We have to reach just enough consensus to interoperate, and no more. In Locke's world, the main \"feature\" of the social contract was property rights. For us, it'll be matters like message schemas. Remember, the goal is to secede from monarchies, not from society.%OwO/TUOpkpq5/1W1F4V8yt+/Q1w4drt8x6sOKEOsZMw=.sha256\n\nconsensus and deliberative democracy are centralised social systemsthe tired western (masculine?) notion that all we need is \"enough public debate\" to hash it all out (lol cryptopuns), that there is some single best opinion that will constitute an eventual consensus, is just so fundamentally broke it's crazy. everyone debating and grandstanding and smarming until they're completely exhausted and can just barely stand each other is the social equivalent of the heat-death of the universe--all ineffectual twitching. no motion. no actual communication.the energy spent arguing with people to define a unified direction, the emotional labour obligate under a \"silence implies consent\" culture, is better spent advancing intersectionally, i.e., along possibly orthogonal lines that help people in important ways not necessarily visible to even a plurality (because the populations aren't aggregated into one group!), ways and directions that shouldn't be made to wait for establishment through an arduous process of consensus global to some domain....it's not just technology that has to be decentralised. the culture has to be decentralised too.%hiYiIWluwlGJWvyEh9Ia3LHX/TQagtUvKaaXCTs/u6Q=.sha256\n\nUsabilityI think the concept of \"usability\" applies at every layer in the stack, for example, nacl is a lot more usable than openssl. That means, it broadens development of crypto, and then those projects have the opportunity to be more usable in turn to their users.%xXabtralTRa1aMpSmR42GhYBCqt1DbfcwPrIWIn7RVM=.sha256\n\nCommunityteaching a man to fish is the easy part, you must then teach his community how to govern a commons%P3/ysGuvI9m4qCacXK+svHzoyMI4uJcymYOKAszJbiM=.sha256\n\n... what it means to have decentralized communication medium.Many of the concepts we have for thinking about this stuff are inadequate,\nfor example, you asked about your \"account\". On a normal website, your account is just a record in a database which says if you know a password, you can post as that account. Before computers, you might have joined a club and \"signed up\" in the club's membership registry (a book). Because computers where first sold to military, then large corporations. Of course computers are about accounting.\nKeeping records about who owns what in books, or book-like systems.In a database system, all the power is in the database. It's often called a \"single source of truth\". Who can do what is ultimately controlled by whoever administers the database.Here, we have no central database to decide for us what a given action means, instead when you make a post or a 'dig' or change your picture, the other peers (or rather, the software they run) interprets that. A social consensus. Like how \"blue\" means what it does because we agree it does, and that agreement can also evolve. \"blue\" means, at least, a color, a sad feeling, and a certain type of film.But what are the implications of a system that doesn't behave like an accounts book? Where could that go?Just trying to understand what it means to be free.%XMerwh7QoerzydCWsDlzgaLU/FD1vIjroHKYaf84B3c=.sha256\n\nIt's true, developers do have a lot of power, and users have very little. \"user\" is another of these words which are problematic in this context. In terms of political empowerment, the implications of \"user\" is a lot like \"pleb\". Developers are like the landed gentry.But, there is a natural right that users always have: they can choose whether or not to run a given piece of software. Developers often act to hamper this right, for example, when you use a website your browser always \"installs\" the latest version. If you download a program and run it, you can at least, keep running the old version, if there isn't an automatic update mechanism (which empowers developers again). There used to be a lot of 3rd party twitter clients, but they stopped that when they introduced advertising, having a centralized system gave them the power to do this easily. The user still has the option to quit facebook, etc, but they must either take it or leave it. It's an ultimatum.But since secure scuttlebutt is a protocol, I can never stop someone from implementing, or choosing to use different software to interpret it. That is why I call it a \"natural right\" it's just there, basically a part of the universe, and you can act to hamper it, but you can never truly take it away.But what happens if you instead act to enhance that natural right?\nIf you make it easier for users to choose their interpretation of reality, and harder for developers to impose ultimatums?Developers get their power from users choosing their software, so if users have more freedom to choose, it will force developers to make better software. To create software that helps users live better lives, instead of herding them like cattle into advertising-milking sheds.But of course, to do that, we actually have to rethink a bunch of stuff.Ultimately, the question is, if we make a better system, will it win?%hQMXHkZBPgO5x8HqiCeHxZKJWFferucYm00Hew9DHEU=.sha256\n\n\"but remember, the value of the internet is ultimately that it's a network of people\"%P1see8CMH8StoXs9CMzwIahrjE+Ht8FeCNjsV3eRgZw=.sha256\n\nDogfoodingWhen it comes to emergency survival situations, it helps a lot if your survival equipment is also the equipment that you use every day.

That is much harder than plain web development. And then easier still is configuring drupal or wordpress. You can still make a hell of a lot with drupal, just by enabling/disabling/configuring modules. This is a pattern that has been demonstrated to be successful in practice.%4etPxosu6kLyjZ2vqLxVFInbmQGXPVa2XcrTsKLICgc=.sha256\n\nThe Ikea ArchitectureWhat is interesting about well designed but cheaply made flat pack furniture? The way that they manage the distinction between essential elements of their design, and arbitary elements of their design.As is obvious to anyone who has assembled an ikea product, they are mostly made from MDF. But that is only half the story. MDF is used for the arbitary part of the design,\nthis season it might look like this, next season, like that. The machinery that cuts out the MDF can cut of any shape (and it's mostly rectangles anyway) so they can iterate on that those aspects of the design as fashion dictates or simply for the sheer hell of it.But there is one thing that doesn't change. _The Hinges incorporate the part of the design that is \"objective\". Not only are the hinges solidly constructed (probably rated for a much heavier door than your little warddrobe) but they are adjustable in 3 dimensions, this means that if the MDF parts don't fit exactly, or if your floor is crooked and your shelf warps, the hinge can just be adjusted so that the door still closes nicely.Handcrafted solid wood furniture would put a lot of effort into making the body of wardrobe solid and sturdy, and could then simple \"butt\" hinges\nBut this furniture must be assembled by an expert craftsperson, and cannot be shipped flat.The Ikea Architecture separates engineering from design. This means that designers don't need to think hard about engineering problems and can simply focus on what customers want to buy.Obviously I am actually talking about software. Specifically, about User Applications. This does not apply to developer tools, because that is nearly entirely engineering. but if you looked at user software, it's mostly mdf, or at least it should be.Tests to check if you have achive Ikea Architecture:can designers easily break your system (fail)\n\nis it easy to repurpose your work into something different (win)\n\nare the hard parts useful for other things? (win)\n\nWhen we talk about \"modular user interfaces\" I think it's misleading, because the things you actually see and touch in a user interface is mostly MDF. there may be a lot of code there, but it isn't interesting.\nIf it is interesting, that is a bad sign that means it should be moved out to a place where it can be solved in isolation, you need to put much more effort into a part that will be reused (it must be reused, to justify that effort)So I think what we really need, if we want \"modular user interfaces\" is some quality Hinges, and an easy way of dealing with the MDF.%5U+7Fblfzf1iO+bE+anI/wn/L9L0LkpM5A9+Mlf0Wcc=.sha256\n\nUncapturableQ: is the npm registry still open source?\nA: no. npm, inc is now intergalactic feudal empirehttps://github.com/npm/registry/issues/41he who controls the spice controls the universe%f6No+0gckncREe2dLT9fRw6MY99AH4SJC+2/bIUd9YI=.sha256\n\n@rabble just gave a very interesting talk at opensourceopensociety here in wellington.largely, it was about how twitter started out as an open platform, and then look a right turn and closed up - but what I didn't know, is that this was actually a reaction to an attempted hostile takeover. Basically, A there was a VC would tried to acquire all the independent twitter clients, and then have them also push to another service, shifting the data out of twitter.com's hand.This was the first I have heard about this, though, but it certainly gives us a more concrete threat model. Since we are basically trying to take the road that twitter didn't.%QRBYdJkoOj1PlIpwhtEcXPBGIcXyugaVwiUhuTSr90g=.sha256\n\n"},"concepts/":{"url":"concepts/","title":"Concepts","keywords":"","body":"ConceptsThis section is a collection of concepts that are useful to understand the scuttleverse.A lot of these are common to many of the current p2p database protocols, however there are important differences to keep in mind.Network Topologytwitter implements a social network (decentralized network of friends and influencers) on a computer network with a different topology (data center hub and user spokes)Twister implement a social network (again, dexnet of friends & followors) on a uniformly distributed decentralized network, user feeds distributed across a DHT (distributed hash table) and a blockchain (for user names) - twister is decentralized, but it's uniformly decentralized, each peer puts in roughly the same commitment of resources, which sounds like a good thing, sure.\nBut this means that twister is a decentralized implementation of a centralized idea, and thus conceputallly centralized.But secure-scuttlebutt is different, it maps a the social network on to a computer network that is essentially the same topology! that is, the connections between humans maps approximately to the the connections between computers. if you follow someone, you really actually follow them at the data layer.I feel this means the user experience is in harmony with the architecture of the system.I can't fairly claim that ssb isn't conceputally centralized right now, because there is only a small number of developers, but there is nothing in the architecture that prevents having many implementations - so if we succeed, I think that will happen.%lmELhGVLXcWrygyG0whgkzkmjlmiB1jZf5EshQ5zfhs=.sha256\n\nbittorrent/DAT like protocols are pretty good for moving heavy data. (video, OS images, etc) the best part is that you collaborate only with other peers who are invested in a particular dataset.But the weakness (in my opinion) is that they rely on a DHT.\nDHTs are bad because peers collaborate anonymously, you have cannot estimate their trustworthyness and consequently, DHTs tend to have poor privacy (because an adversary could easily add peers that monitor you) and poor sybil resistance (again, because you have no way to know that a peer is \"near you\" or \"on your side\")This happens because work is distributed between peers uniformly.\nPeers are mapped into a hash ring, so to get a hash, you traverse peers closer and closer to your target.One of the core ideas in ssb is to map the computer network along the social network (thus defeating spam, because you arn't friends with spammers)%0asWjhFa51ri/OOSXJgC/aUweNzhxHi2/7+PXhwUzH8=.sha256\n\nPermissionssecure-scuttlebutt absolutely aims to grow into a pretty good decentralized database,\nbut because it's decentralized that means it's gonna turn out pretty different to say, mysql.The fundamental difference being that in a decentralized database, \"permissions\" are enforced by the reader, not the writer (or rather, receiver of the write - \"the database\")%qn9zPU/d8021Cpv5/t7FFZv8eoUUDDOJ8xdhor5w+bA=.sha256\n\nThis is the thing which is fundamentally different with this decentralized architecture than with centralized. In a centralized database, the database is the point of control. Who has permission to write what is determined by the database. In this decentralized architecture, if you want to write something, just write it. the other clients will decide whether that write was valid, and accept or ignore it.%KSSrusb3gQsRe6d3ZkKfiQTrGWM7OB1ePNEh6yzsA8I=.sha256\n\n"},"concepts/identity.html":{"url":"concepts/identity.html","title":"Identity","keywords":"","body":"IdentityYour identity is \"who you are\".True NameIn Scuttlebutt, your True Name is represented as an ed25519 key pair using libsodium (why?).The private key is your secret not to be shared with anyone. The public key is used as your identifier.There is no worldwide store of identities. Users must exchange pubkeys, either by publishing them on their feeds, or out-of-band.There is no session, and no logon. your identity is represented by a private key that is stored in on your computer.In ordinary websites, the server is the guardian of your identity,\nand grants it to you. This is the reverse, you are your own guardian.When you make a post, it creates a signed record, that appends to a history of things you have done. When my computer sees your messages,it knows it's, well, actually it doesn't know who you are, but it knows you are the same identity as before.%ox29TwlaATzXebEwpmzenTQKD2XN2cBrihCsHNm6qKE=.sha256\n\nSo in the future, how i figure it will work, is when a child is born, the parents generate a private key for it. The parents could easily know the private key... and maybe that is for the best. But later, when the child is mature enough to understand the consequences, they would generate their own private key. Now they are cryptographically an adult.%9M3KSMrxigeIxJDIdVgm9HmBL7dg71eHMVnGYwDbByI=.sha256\n\noh, sorry, let me clarify one thing I said wrong.There are two types of asymmetric cryptography (not actually the whole story but will do for now) signing, and exchange.you create a signature with a signing (private) key, and it's verified with a corresponding public key.Then there are also exchange keys, or called diffie-helman keys. There isn't really a widely used name for this type of key, mainly i think because it doesn't have a simple real-world metaphor like \"signing\" does. Anyway, exchange keys take your public key, and my secret key then combines the together to produces a shared exchange key.In nacl this operation is called scalarmult. That is an implementation detail really, in classic DiffieHelman a different mathematical operation is used, but it has the same behavior. That is, we can each take the other's public key, and our own secret key, and produce a key that essentially represents a relationship between us.In nacl both types of keys are used, signing keys are ed25519 keys, and exchange keys are curve25519 keys. sign uses ed25519 keys, and scalarmult takes curve25519.\nbox takes two exchange keys, and then uses scalarmult internally. There is also another function secretbox that just takes a symmetric key, say the output of scalarmult.To encrypt a private key, you probably don't encrypt it to anyone, so secretbox is the one to use. Also, you'll need to generate the key the first time, and then later, you'll need to restore it. To do that, you need a seed. That is just a random number, but make sure it's really random. instead of encrypting the private key, encrypt the seed, then regenerate the keypair from that seed.%lBglUeQhHbKRGigcXXZmeQOTXisoSAI9J3X6vnxsDhA=.sha256\n\nNick NamesIn Scuttlebutt, anyone can set a nickname (petname) for another peer. It's akin to a human-memorable symlink to a cryptographic identifier.The web you are familiar with is organized like a property system. If you can claim a username, you \"own\" it. not here. here, you name is whatever people call you.\nYou can suggest a name, and an avatar, and we can use it. and you can rename us. This may seem unfamiliar at this point in history, but it is the natural way of the world.%1H99noUzO+kUrj8zwX0stfuUvX29X8HgXjHErfnwkOY=.sha256\n\nIn a centralized system, the database is the source of all truth and enforcer of rules. Enforcing a rule like \"all names must be unique!\" is easy.In a decentralized system, like ssb, there is no single source of truth. peers must enforce a rule with collective action. This makes for a lot more wiggle room. To put it in database terms, it means anyone can write anything, but other clients will ignore what they think is invalid.So, names is patchwork are somewhat like IRC, except that when I mention you @akkartik it records both your human name and your public key, then I sign this message, so there is a cryptographic record that I call @1DfC2qFuXuli/HOg3kJbKwxiOpc3jXLdJD3TnhtzWNs=.ed25519 \"akkartik\"I can call you anything. Unlike IRC, but like \"real life\", other people choose your name. So, in ssb, a name is just a mapping from a string to a cryptographic token (i.e. public key, and git-ssb repos also have names)If I start using a new name for you, my old messages will still bear the name I used then, but it would still link to your public key.%7hcvpITRduLDNKpLqN6Xm+8d/t7aQu2YqZhBO3CtSC0=.sha256\n\nDon't ask anyone's opinion on a name, that is just a bikeshed, get people to use it and see what they call it. Let names emerge, like winning at charades.%am/DGQpKliHYgsYgUUXk4UHwz9rgn+0WN4oc4yq97Mw=.sha256\n\n@amnovak just because you can name it anything doesn't mean that it will be total chaos.\nNo one enforces natural language, we can invent new words that \"arn't in the dictionary\", but since people want to be understood, that is enough consistency.%nrZecbFGe/Vx7tSUAfZMWM2/wZKnC7CdyTyvo6R7mxI=.sha256\n\npetnames should be a user aid: you can enter the url as a petname, and then the computer gives you back the exact name, which you can share securely. we loose a lot more than we gain with a naming registry. like, the recent npm thing. names become \"property\" instead of granted by the community.%oJtA0Lmj7PBo9KmkC99/cVHhNzi9+ulXAwvJvMIJY60=.sha256\n\nYes! Anyway, all naming is subjective!\nIt's just that sometimes one opinion is privledged above others.%9s3P86A9UoiMpsGg/ffiIs0zl6YpDXvAl3MW7vP39t0=.sha256\n\nTrustImplicit vs. Explicit: we can interpret something like twitter or fb or the web as a \"reputation network\", but most people don't actually think about that while they use it. So, just create an implicit reputation network, people just use it because it works for them, you don't need to pitch them on \"reputation network\".For example, google traverses the links on all the websites they find, analyzes that graph and uses them to determine a ranking for all websites. That ranking score can be interpreted as \"reputation\". The authors of those web links may not be thinking \"here is a reputable site\" or \"I want to increase this website's score\" but you can interpret this as an expression of trust, not because of the link but more because of the sites they choose not to link to. Linking is an action that expresses trust (involves a risk), not just a statement \"I trust X\", which is pretty cheap.Another really interesting thing about page rank, is the graph represents a mathematical model of how humans \"surf\" the internet. refresher: before search engines where any good, you'd just click around from links to links, go to some site, follow it's links, etc. pagerank simulated this, calculating the probability that if you'd land on a given page if you spent your life just randomly clicking on links. I think the key here is that pagerank is based on a model of what humans already do, it just makes it faster.Gameability - how easy is it to create the appearance of trust/value?\nsystems like ebay have \"feedback\" which seems easy, and works in the case of ebay because ebay charges a transaction fee which would make it expensive to create a fake reputation. For example: I could create a bunch of ebay accounts and make my sock puppet accounts \"buy\" from me, then give me good feedback, so it would appear I made many transactions. However, even though I don't post the goods (to myself) I'd still have to pay the ebay transaction fee! So if you see someone on ebay who has made thousands of transactions, the transaction fees for those may add up to more than they could make if they ripped me off one one transaction, so I can be pretty confidant in making that purchase.In a decentralized system like ssb, an identity is just a key pair, and I could generate thousands of those a second, it would be really easy to create sock puppets that appeared to \"trust\" me. Any realistic reputation system would need to have a way to rule this out - a straight sum of all the feedback probably wouldn't work, but something that traced a social graph might.%1S7PrZmAAC3foX/aAIO0wRoaFnVG9xL3YMvnKwba4xQ=.sha256\n\n\"trust\" and \"reputation\" have no formal definition, and everyone \"already knows\" what they mean. sillicon valley has coopted the term \"reputation\" where it's something they calculate from their mass of data. in a human context, \"reputation\" is obviously subjective, although, to some degree an estimation of a collective sense of trust. In an honour-amoungst-theves sense, one community can esteeme someone highly, doesn't mean another community sees it like that. I have been meaning to try and write a glossary of ways people use the term \"trust\" and \"reputation\" because there are too many senses to agree on a definition. That WoT thing was just frustrating, for me, because everyone had a valid view, that was completely different.%Dwd9MKS1uD+yM1MeiiYLgYrTujtkrWoKHhV9bZzeQn0=.sha256\n\nGroupsTo summarize, our ideas are that a group, by definition has an inside and an outside, and they also may have internal behaviour and external behaviour. Internal behaviour means it's possible to communicate privately with other members, external behaviour means it's possible for the group to speak/act as one. I want it to be possible to follow a group like you would follow an individual, ideally without needing the ssb to treat it differently (that depends on the right crypto though)this thread has a good summary of our group ideas%b8/CYP0xj+fXgB2u5eDOQUbBCqyJ+sXv/CvuZNDOVVA=.sha256\n\n"},"concepts/stream.html":{"url":"concepts/stream.html","title":"Stream","keywords":"","body":"Streamyou can think of an array as a structure that you move past... like one of those fancy old libraries with the moving ladder.

So bitcoin is 1 blockchain, ssb is many sigchains.The following will be true of pretty much any secure decentralized system:Both use hashes as links to build structures. bitcoin and ssb are both based around chain structures. ssb also use links to create trees (eg, discussion threads)Both use signatures to represent an actions performed by an identity, and public keys to represent that identity.%o7qQdE9/NKbNuy1anZIoOWrnsfFF3Cef7ozZwrNcRdQ=.sha256\n\nIt mainly differs in philosophy. secure-scuttlebutt avoids not just centralization, but also global singletons. So there is no DHT.\nBoth are built on the concepts of hashes as links and public keys as identity.Then the main structure in ssb is that each user's feed is an append-only signed chain. This structure is very simple, and optimized for efficient replication. To get all you latest updates, I just have to tell a mutual friend the latest sequence number I have received from you.\n(on ipfs, i'd have to work backwards from your latest ipns value)\nI think a forward replicating database is easier to reason about and build other things on top of.Since there is no global network, everything depends on your social network. That is the gamble here. But, I think it's a good one. Life has confusingly many options - but we have a simple solution, ask your friends. Spam filtration is the same thing from the other end, what do i not want to see. Take things like the search on google play store - it's so fully of crap (and full of spam reviews) that you are better off asking on twitter. I call twitter solicited spam. since it's pull only, it just doesn't have the same spam problems as email (except for mentions/replies/favs)By default, you replicate the feeds you directly follow, and the feeds they follow. this provides availability for the network, and also means you can see replies from someone you don't directly follow. it creates a soft boundry to your social network, so once we scale, you won't get spam in your mentions, etc.%XnwMywLJAWqRXCAt9YmPuIghlr9tyAZNiKgbDOg385g=.sha256\n\nNon-repudiationWith a signature chain, you'd still have that even if it where possible to \"forget\" parts, because someone probably has that post, and they'd be able to come forward, and everyone could verify that was the deleted post.Having peruasive non-repudation also means that you can't claim someone said something they didn't, so you can't post a doctored screenshot because no one will believe it.%ZmudAToEvD6baAFDkrUjj28ySXhI7CRGWRvuYLwMmtQ=.sha256\n\n@johnny that is true. You could abandon your account, throw your hands up and claim \"i've been hacked!!!\" that might be a bit harder to pull off credibly (depending on exactly what you where trying to delete)But I have a more radical idea, I'm not sure if the world is ready for it, but here it is: you could apologise. Then the bad post would show back links to the apology, and readers could interpret it in the new context.%xwlk7+jk+jTLvaTq/0G8T5YaoXTacM7Gb7Ko8xVUtuY=.sha256\n\nnote: we havn't really discussed \"off-the-record\" much here in patchworkland, but it's often argued that that is the dominant mode of natural human communication. Most casual communications (face to face) do not create a trail of evidence, and either party can claim that they didn't say what the other said they did. Sometimes people like to imbibe certain substances which increases denyability! even in a business context! if you went drinking with clients while negioating a deal that is like denyable encryption, but (hopefully) you wait until the next day when you are sober to sign the contract (on the record).ssb/patchwork doesn't do denyable, but you could use it to bootstrap another protocol which was denyable.%Xp2EDToHDgeDzyFEYVPM2wv57p/HDjxGsLkJuYPCeaI=.sha256\n\nConsistencyI hate to rain on a parade, but one thing is that the relationship between boats is a lot more libertarian than the relationship between the crew of one boat. Even Plato uses the example of the ship at sea to argue for his idea of the geek dictator (\"philosopher king\").\nThe crew are literally \"all in the same boat\" and so there isn't really much room for disagreement. Historically, western culture has decided that the best way to run a boat is under the command of a single captian, and not many people have argued with this. I wouldn't be surprised if it's impossible to ensure the boat without a designated captian. I think this will create a tension that you'll have to work around, at least.On the other hand, if this was a flotilla of boats... then I think you'd begin to see a natural harmony between you idea and decentralization. Islands of consistency in a sea of eventualness.Prehaps, you could pitch this not as a single vessel, but as a prototype for a flotilla... maybe invite current sea captians to join your network? That way you might be able to release some of the inevitable pressure of forcing participants into too small a space (1 ship)%2vsznn20SD82ChXVcMKKt4J2/Cjcle1pjMFI+bpYjkM=.sha256\n\nMonotonic@johnny monotonic chains make replication easy.%qSbpvIFz41EhBtIuI3UZzGbRNUhVtGdVAAUpYsJHsPU=.sha256"},"concepts/message.html":{"url":"concepts/message.html","title":"Message","keywords":"","body":"MessagePatchwork is one particular interpretation of the ssb protocol. using patchwork you click buttons and type into fields and patchwork creates cryptographic messages which are replicated over ssb.

It is designed according to the audit-driven crypto design process. You can find the repository on at github:dominictarr/private-boxWhen you want a message to be private, it is encrypted end-to-end with private-box\nSo gossipers will still see the cyphertext of your message, but will not see the plaintext. best of all, the recipients (including the number of recipient!) is also encrypted, so a patchwork private message leakes much less metadata than GPG. (it's obviously a message for someone in the network, but there is no clues who*)Excepting timing information. To obsecure timing information, you'd post messages randomly and relay encrypted sends.

Lets say I send a message \"ES6 is a cancer\" - any plaintext prose like this has a myriad of interpretations - it doesn't mean I have cancer. If I send a bunch of messages to a doctor who is a cancer expert... uh, probably I wouldn't do that unless I had cancer. To analyze the content, you kinda need a human who can interpret the context. very expensive. But analyzing the metadata graph is very easy. That is why in all the snowden stuff, they hardly analyze the content at all.The approach you are suggesting is to show the recipient, but allow the recipient to wear a mask. and just change masks rapidly. I'm not ruling out whether this could be made to work - but it would be a lot harder to prove that it works, where as if we encrypt the \"to\" field we can examin the cryptographic part of the protocol and convince our selves: yup, no way to tell who the recipient is.regards the replay attack: it would actually be pretty simple to prevent. we just have to introduce something so that a message does not decrypt correctly in a different context. currently, a private-box message has a nonce at the start which is used in all the encryptions in that message. If I copied that whole message it would be the same, but if it worked a different way: instead of using the random nonce - use a hmac of hmac(author + previous, random_nonce) then that the same content copied into another message would now not decrypt. no surprising replays.%lgiAaiHPnz+/+B5K7v3nPR/sK/FBlCRb0qiIuvr6ims=.sha256\n\n"},"concepts/link.html":{"url":"concepts/link.html","title":"Link","keywords":"","body":"Linkwhat I recall is @substack suggested \"cypherlink\" as the term for a hash used as a link (also called a merkle link in ipfs) which I liked because it sounded like a riff on \"hyperlink\" and \"cypherpunk\".

They are:@ for feeds\n\n% for messages\n\n& for blobs\n\nAdditionally, each ID has a \"tag\" appended to indicate the hash or key algorithm.

Scuttlebot maintains a table of known peers, which it cycles through, asking for updates for all followed feeds.Since the messages are always signed, information can be distributed in any way, such as through a sneakernet. For example, you could put the latest gossip on an SD card and send it to your friend via pigeon post.ssb is persisted without you going out of your way, it may be hang off of you for ever, but it's not a burden on you, you don't need to do anything to maintain that, except to continue being friends with people.%Cd6YRARJX29mkaP798JII3WwmlOWXEs6v8p1GjsSZL8=.sha256\n\nYou could argue that ssb is a pub/sub protocol.\nBandwidth may be important, but it's not gonna be the architectural deal breaker that latency will be.

You have to advertise which blobs you have on a DHT, accessible to everyone, so you'll never have very good privacy about which blobs you have.Where as, by gossiping the blobs, you'll get some extras, and you can plausably claim \"I was just holding this for a friend\"%Ooe/pswWabTDRm8gg+t5jfHzYzYUq/QHCRSnPtWelqg=.sha256\n\nthe real problem is a bit more detailed than that. Even if you could easily address any device, that doesn't mean you could host a website on your phone. well, you could, sure, but that would just mean you have to keep your phone constantly on and connected.The more important thing about applications like ssb and ipfs etc, is that they may operate \"offline\" you connect address and connect to the data, not the device.The device is temporary and the data is not. That is completely the other way around from traditional systems. It helps here to remember just how modern crypto is. Modern Cryptography (hashes + signatures) is less than half as old as computer science. MC was only invented in the late 70's, but computer science was invented in the 30s (turing machines, etc)The internet existed before crypto, and so did unix.\nWe are only just figuring out how to build things with crypto...\nAddressability is the easy part. we want to be able to publish from your phone, but we don't actually want everyone in the world to be connecting to it, that would just DDOS your phone.

Basically, finding some way to create a \"real cost\" to creating an identity in the system.\nBitcoin does this with proof of work, because processors & electricity are expensive. Ethereum enables you to do this with money. Often, centralized services require you to confirm your phone number (using the price of simcards).The other method is to do some kind of network analysis. This is broadly the approach that ssb uses - here independent parties post \"follow\" messages which bring that peer into your network. https://www.stellar.org/ is anothe example of this approach.\nFor a voting system, you could have each peer state who they accept the votes of, and discount peers that are not strongly connected to yourself. This is based on the assumption that it would be difficult to for an attacker to trick many people into expressing \"trust\" in them. This would require people being educated to take that expression fairly seriously, though.Maybe, if a sybil swarm did sneak in, and made a reckless proposal, the rest could sever their network from those sybils - just succeed.Of course, all of these approaches should probably be considered unproven...%oDcN+0dus8WD7J985vjOmewyftoIN9/8j2GrtG3Guck=.sha256\n\nOh, the other problem, is that to usable in the face of spam, email as push messaging depends on content and metadata analysis.

Feel free to respond with any suggestions or questions. My interest in Scuttlebutt was piqued by @andrestaltz's post, An Off-Grid Social Network, especially how the decentralized, peer-to-peer architecture works to support offline use and avoids reliance on any servers with special authority.Scuttlebutt applications depend on a server component that maintains the connection with the Scuttlebutt network. Many Scuttlebutt applications, including Patchwork, use Scuttlebot in this role as a server, and interact with the Scuttlebutt network via Scuttlebot. The first time you run Scuttlebot (or an application using it), an identity is created (in the form of a public and private key pair) and this identity is used by all applications that communicate via Scuttlebot.sbot is a command line tool included with Scuttlebot. To install it, install the scuttlebot Node.js package globally by running:npm install --global scuttlebot\nThis should let you run sbot on the command line. Let's start by using whoami to verify that sbot can connect to a Scuttlebot server and has the right identity.If you are connected to the Scuttlebutt network, this command should return a user ID. For example, this shows running sbot whoami and it returning my user ID:$ sbot whoami\n{\n  \"id\": \"@btxEYD1gibOZZKbtxJFTQ2m560U3zIgbZ2vII93WCIk=.ed25519\"\n}\nIf you are not connected to the network, you will see an error message like this:$ sbot whoami\nError: Could not connect to the scuttlebot server.\nUse the \"server\" command to start it.\nTo connect to the network, you can either start Patchwork or another application that uses Scuttlebot, or run sbot server, which starts the server component.On the Scuttlebutt network, each user has a feed or log made up of messages signed by the user. Only the user can write to their feed, since only the user should possess the identity's private key and be able to sign messages with it. Users interact with each other by publishing messages on their own feed that mention users, establish a follow link with another user, or link to the message of another user.Let's use the latestSequence command to find how many items are in my feed. For example, this shows running sbot latestSequence with one argument (my user ID) and it returning the last sequence number in my feed and the timestamp of this item:$ sbot latestSequence \"@btxEYD1gibOZZKbtxJFTQ2m560U3zIgbZ2vII93WCIk=.ed25519\"\n{\n  \"sequence\": 24,\n  \"ts\": 1491624622201\n}\nUsing JavaScript, I can convert this timestamp into a localized date to verify that this was the date and time of my last message:$ echo \"console.log(new Date(1491624622201).toLocaleString());\" | node\n4/7/2017, 11:10:22 PM\nNext, let's use the createUserStream command to retrieve items from my feed. This command has many options, including a mode to perform a full retrieval of the feed and a live mode where messages appear in real-time as they arrive.With the limit argument, we can retrieve the first item from my feed.

It's definition is loose, and is often just meant to refer to this entire thing, in the way someone refers to \"the internet\" or \"this afternoon\".  In this case, the thing is the idea of a network organized similar to an actual social graph, which communicates messages in a way similar to gossip.SSB stands for SecureScuttleButt.  It is the protocol through which we can exchange messages, read each others' feeds, and make friends.  You could compare it to TCP, which is an underlying protocol for how devices connect to one another on the internet.  TCP is a network protocol, though, while SSB is a local protocol.  This means it doesn't require any sort of  internet connection to work.Patchwork,Patchbay, and Patchfoo are different applications used to interpret and display the various messages transmitted through SSB.  A rough analogy would be that if SSB was like TCP, then an application like Patchwork would be like a web browser.A better analogy for all of this would be that Patchwork is a car you ride in and SecureScuttlebutt is the road you drive on. There are other types of cars that drive on the same road and you can drive a different car to the same place (car = application, road = protocol).With this analogy, the current car models for driving on ssb are:\n    \\- Patchwork: family station wagon\n    \\- Patchbay: pickup truck\n    \\- Patchfoo: jeep\n    \\- git-ssb: digger.\n\nSourcesThe answer is compiled from multiple posts from this thread.

Then I  found out the  best thing to do would be to join a pub.  Are these like servers? Or people? Or drinking clubs?To best answer this question, we should first explain how Scuttlebutt is designed to work.Scuttlebutt works through word of mouth among your friend groups...literally.  With Scuttlebutt, You write things in your diary and then, the next time you are near a friend, share what you've written.  This friend then shares your diary entry with all their friends and soon all the  awesome things you wrote has spread  across your social network. This \"gossiping\" is simple to do if you are physically near a friend, since Scuttlebutt works with just a local router.  If you cannot be physically near, and want to connect over the internet, it could be tremendously hard to find a direct connection to your friend across the vastness of all possible connections.  That is where pubs come in to help.Pubs(named after real life pubs, or \"public houses\") are a peer you can follow that helps you catch up on the gossip and feed of your network.  They act sort of as both bar and barfly, someone who never leaves the party and makes friends with everyone, and seems to always know the latest gossip.  In (slightly) more technical terms, pubs are servers that have a static IP address, are always online, and always follow you back when you follow them (thus growing their network).  In this way, they can act as a waypoint for you to find the location of your friends and catch up with them.When you first get started on Scuttlebutt it can appear incredibly empty until you \"join\" a pub.  You can find a list of pubs to join here.  Though it is important to note that you aren't joining a server, you're more making a connection with a person that is also a place and is also neither.  And metaphors are hard.This concept of pubs is one of the densest and most complex with Scuttlebutt. You can read more about it here and here.  Or just not worry about it too much right now and simply  know: while pubs are not required to use scuttleverse they certainly make it simpler. Just like in real life, when you are new to the area, a pub is a great way to meet new friends.Sources_Answer compiled mostly from this thread.

Following = intention to replicate that persons data where-ever you find it (you find that data via other people via gossip).following more pubs = finding out about more people\ngetting more pubs to follow you = more always-online nodes that for-sure replicate your messagesSourcesThanks to @Ds for asking the question and @winmix for the answer!"},"faq/basics/gossip.html":{"url":"faq/basics/gossip.html","title":"What do you mean SSB works through gossip?","keywords":"","body":"What do you mean when you say SSB works with Gossip?Is gossip some esoteric computer science protocol, or do you mean like real-life gossip?Both!Part of the philosophy behind Scuttlebutt is that software should better represent how humans actually relate.

In other words, the architecture beneath everything is inspired by actual human behavior, and is built to function like human behavior.There are some great pages posted on scuttlebutt.nz that go into gossip as a protocol,found here.

You can find it by opening up your terminal and, from the home directory, typing in ls -a.

So making a friend, adding a display picture, or posting your recipe on baked beans are all messages; each of a different type.  As SSB grows, so will the breadth of messages it is capable of sharing.  Today you can use SSB to not only send status updates, but also update code through git pull requests, or upload and share songs.However, different applications will have different opinions on what types of messages it can send and receive. For example:  Patchwork, as the family station wagon, is concerned with general posts, display images, profiles, and friends.  It doesn't track any pull requests sent through git-ssb.  Patchbay, on the other hand, is a pickup truck built for utility and so handles everything Patchwork can handle plus git messages and more.What this means is that if you are on Patchwork and your friend is on Patchbay, and your friend posts their opinion on John Wick 2, you will be able to see it.  But if your friend makes a pull request to update the code on their John Wick 2 dating sim, you would not be able to see it because Patchwork has no opinion on that type of message.SourcesThe answer is compiled from multiple posts from this thread.
